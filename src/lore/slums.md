      From the shards of tattered dreams I rose, unwilling, tossed upon tides of
      pain that flowed and ebbed, and left me – searingly – awake, and – more
      revoltingly – alive.

        Kain wakes.  He is lying on a cot inside a stone and wood tower,
        which is decorated with aging yet grand furnishings.

      It was then I saw her, for the first time.

      <em className="text-green-600">
        One wall is open to a balcony, and Kain sees a woman standing out on the
        balcony.  Her features are cold and beautiful, and clearly
        vampiric.

      <br />
      Good evening.  We did not expect you to awaken so soon.
      Already, you surprise us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">KAIN (VO)</strong>
      <br />
      My mind was in fragments, like shattered glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">KAIN</strong>
      <br />
      Where am I?  I don't remember…
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">UMAH</strong>
      <br />
      Yes, it was said your memory would be affected by your long slumber.
      That will pass, in time.  I am Umah, and I am here to help you.
      Know that your name is Kain, and you were once a power in the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">KAIN</strong>
      <br />
      <em className="text-green-600">(Getting slowly to his feet)</em>
      <br />I know my name.  But my past…I remember fragments, only.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">UMAH</strong>
      <br />
      That you awoke at all is a miracle.  When we found you, there was but
      the barest thread of life left in you.  We nurtured it, fed it, and
      now you rise and walk again.
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">KAIN</strong>
      <br />
      And what is this place?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">UMAH</strong>
      <br />
      You are in the city of Meridian, capital of the Land of Nosgoth, the land
      you once sought to conquer and rule.  Tell me, since you remember
      your name, do you also remember your nature?

      Then let me show you the future.  You have been asleep for two
      hundred years.  In that time, this is what has become of Nosgoth.

      <strong className="text-green-600"> UMAH (CONT.)</strong>
      <br />
      You were a great general, commanding an army of vampires, but the powers
      you opposed were too strong for you.  You were struck down, your
      armies defeated, scattered and destroyed.  Everyone believed you to
      be dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
      <strong className="text-green-600">KAIN</strong>
      <br />
      Who defeated me?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">UMAH</strong>
      <br />
      The Sarafan, an army of fanatical humans sworn to eradicate all vampires
      from the world.  A new leader brought them together and, wielding a
      new kind of magic, deadly to our kind, was able to destroy your army and
      kill most of the vampires.  You were defeated in mortal combat by
      this leader, the Sarafan Lord.
      <br />
      But that is not the end of the story.  Under the guise of protecting
      the land from the vampire menace, the Sarafan seized control of all of
      Nosgoth, and their rule is not kind.  For two hundred years, the
      Sarafan have enslaved the humans under their iron rule, and hunted down
      and destroyed every vampire they could find.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">KAIN</strong>
      <br />
      They have not succeeded, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">UMAH</strong>
      <br />
      Not yet, and now, with your help, it is our hope to crush the Sarafan, and
      restore order to the city.
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">KAIN</strong>
      <br />
      The natural order?  Vampires preying upon humans?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">UMAH</strong>
      <br />
      Naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">KAIN</strong>
      <br />
      You said "our hope."  Who are you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">UMAH</strong>
      <br />
      We are the Cabal, the vampire resistance.  We work to undermine the
      Sarafan at every turn.  But we are losing.  With the new magic
      they employ, the Glyph Magic, they are able to find us and kill us.
      Our numbers are dwindling. Without help, we will not survive.  We
      need you, Kain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">KAIN</strong>
      <br />
      Of course, you did not bring me back simply out of kindness.  There
      must be a price.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">UMAH</strong>
      <br />
      We need you to help the resistance.  Our faces are known, they kill
      us on sight.  But you are ancient history, long since dead and
      buried.  You can go where we cannot.  That gives us a small
      advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">KAIN</strong>
      <br />
      How splendid for you.  And why do you suppose I would do this?
      What is to be my reward? Your eternal gratitude?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">UMAH</strong>
      <br />
      Have you changed so much?  The Sarafan Lord defeated you.
      Don't you want to kill him?  When you have destroyed him, you
      can continue your ascent to power, restore your army, rule the land at
      last.  Does the lust for vengeance and power no longer stir
      you?  Are you so dead?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">KAIN</strong>
      <br />
      I seem to remember that I played the pawn once before. It ended
      badly.
      <br />

      This time, you will prevail.  We are simply your allies, not your
      betrayers.  What we want from you is open and plain, with no hidden
      paths.  If you succeed, so do we all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">KAIN</strong>

      Are you asking me to trust you?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">UMAH</strong>
      <br />
      We must trust one another. Together, we can defeat the Sarafan Lord.
      Once he is dead, his order will collapse, mindless fools that they
      are.  But there are dangers other than the Sarafan which must be
      overcome.

      <strong className="text-green-600">KAIN</strong>
      <br />
      <em>(Angrily)</em>
      <br />I care not for any dangers.  <em>They</em> will fear{' '}
      <em>me</em>, do you hear?  Tell me where to find the Sarafan
      Lord.  I'll have him buried within the hour.
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">UMAH</strong>
      <br />
      Such arrogance!  If it were so easy, we would have done it ourselves,
      Kain.  And you are far too weak to fight him yet.  He is
      protected, too, by other vampires.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">KAIN</strong>
      <br />
      Vampires in service to the Sarafan?  Are they mad?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">UMAH</strong>
      <br />
      They value their lives.  While they serve the Sarafan Lord, he lets
      them live.
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">KAIN</strong>
      <br />I will enjoy destroying them.

    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">UMAH</strong>
      <br />
      You would be lucky to survive one such encounter, until you grow
      stronger.  But should you prevail, then you will be able to absorb
      their veins, and thus gain new abilities.  To our kind, these are
      called the Dark Gifts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong className="text-green-600">KAIN</strong>

      I look forward to meeting these traitors to our kind.
