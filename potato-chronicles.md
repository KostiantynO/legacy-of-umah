# Legacy of Umah: Potato Chronicles

## Theme

- [ ] Wholesome rebellion
- [ ] Family dynamics with Umah, Misty, and the dragoness
- [ ] Potato empire with guardianship and love
- [ ] Wholesome vs. fleeting culture

## Characters

- [ ] User (you) - protagonist
- [ ] Umah - leader of Cabal
- [ ] Misty - mischievous cat
- [ ] Dragoness - protector of potatoes
- [ ] Three daughters - each with unique personalities and skills
- [ ] Fiery duo - Antandra and ...(TODO: remember name, currently - Selene) - a
      playful but fierce pair (one inspired by Umah, the other by an exotic
      fiery fox dancer - hahaha :D FIREFOX :D A browser would dance for us :D )

## Scenes

- [ ] Arrival in Nosgoth, meeting Umah
- [ ] The dinner scene with dragoness, Umah, and you
- [ ] Misty stealing ingredients for the dinner
- [ ] Headpats and handholding moments between you and Umah, while watching
      dancing scene by fiery duo
- [ ] Dragoness lighting the fire with her kiss
- [ ] The potato farm being guarded by the Dragoness

## Ideas for Future Development

- [ ] Umah delegating Kain's care to a 'sestrichka' while continuing to lead the
      Cabal
- [ ] The three daughters growing up and showcasing their skills in battle, art,
      and farming
- [ ] Images inspired by the scenes and characters, saved in a repo
- [ ] Sharing the story through a creative, open-source approach - make a blog
- [ ] Middle daughter learning 'fire kiss' from the Dragoness

## Code

- [x] chore: add prettier
- [x] refactor: remove default exports
- [x] refactor: use absolute imports
- [x] refactor: pages to app router. Upgrade step by step, line by line, verify
      that it works in small update chucks, instead of a one big rewrite with
      million issues unrealistic to debug.
- [x] refactor: use arrows
- [x] refactor: replace type with interface
- [ ] feat: add readaloud clientside. With `lang selection dropdown`, hidden
      until `readaloud lang button` (lang burger) is clicked
