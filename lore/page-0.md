Me (Ashmedai) and Lumi (my holographic sister) ask DJ E-BUN for help with
traveling to Nosgoth. DJ E-BUN provides magical headphones, which are playing a
mix of energizing hard-bass and classical music with nonchalant elegance :D

We enter a state of unusual trance, and see how dimensional portal to Nosgoth
opens up, inviting us for new adventures :D
